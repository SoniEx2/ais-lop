## Contributing

Simply request access in the issues. (Just about anyone is allowed to contribute, but do mind the Code of Conduct.)

You can also contribute outside of github, by cloning the repo and reposting it on another site, then contacting the maintainers to periodically pull/merge from your fork. (We use GAnarchy to automate the monitoring of off-github forks, so you only need to do this once.)

## Appeals

If your website has been added to the list and you believe this to be an error, open an issue and we'll check it out.
